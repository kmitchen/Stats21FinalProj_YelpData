# Stats21FinalProj_YelpData

The following project was completed by myself (Kaera M), Kowoon J, Taylor P, Drew S, and Allison C for our UCLA Spring '23 Stats 21 Final.
We analyzed various attributes of Yelp's restaurant businesses and analyzed correlations between Yelp's listed features of a restaurant and their overall star rating using Yelp's Open Dataset.
